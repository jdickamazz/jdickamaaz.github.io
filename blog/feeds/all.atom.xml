&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My New Year's resolution is to blog regularly, even if it means writing random nonsense that has little to do with research. To start, I wanted to tell the story of my health for my research career. This is not a pity party but a documentary effort. Now that I think I have (fingers crossed) closed this chapter of my life, I feel ready to write a bit about it. A lot of this story is about me being stupid. Don't be stupid like me.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beginnings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had my first seizure when I was 21, on Thanksgiving day my senior year of college. After four days straight of roughly 2-3 hours of sleep a night, I collapsed in the living room while studying for a final. Losing the ability to read while looking at a dense math book is strange---I wasn't sure if I was just out of my depth or something was actually wrong until I felt a buzzing numb sensation move up my body while trying to sound out the word "the." As I woke up, I thought my dad was kidding when he told me I had just had a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday. Every year around 15 of my family get together for smoked turkey, pumpkin pie, the works. I must say a soggy vending machine turkey-cranberry sandwich doesn't quite replace that. However it's a blessing that it happened when I was home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, I actually&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; had my first seizure four months earlier. I was living alone, doing a depressingly boring manual test engineer internship for a defense prime. One night, I recall waking up in a daze, with sore muscles. I was a bit confused but didn't think much of it, and went to bed. The next day coworkers asked me if I had been in a fight, or had too much to drink---my face was bruised but I couldn't recall why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, after &lt;em&gt;the  Thanksgiving Seizure&lt;/em&gt; I came back with a &lt;em&gt;subconjunctival hemorrhage&lt;/em&gt;. It sounds scary for what it is, basically a bruise inside your eyeball that turns the whites of the eye red. It was a great way to get some pity from instructors, collaborators, and friends, but I flunked that final nonetheless and barely passed the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first neurologist was ok with me refusing to go on medication. In hindsight, this was an outrageously stupid stance for me to take, but one of my closest friends had also recently become epileptic&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I had watched the way his witches' brew of drugs had sapped his vitality and mental speed&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and resolved to avoid this fate at all costs, including risking further seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acclimation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next few years, I was unmedicated, and had sufficiently infrequent seizures that I could pretend to live a normal life. I stopped driving&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but living in the dense neighborhoods around ASU made this a limited impediment. Through my first four years as an epileptic, I came to live with the roughly 4 to 8 seizures a year. Less than one a month isn't that bad, 
right??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned to recognize my &lt;em&gt;aura&lt;/em&gt;---the signs of a coming episode---over time. It was a loss of the ability to read, speak, or understand speech. It had deja-vu-like sensations, and a feeling that's almost impossible to put into words, like the sense that my own inner monologue was speaking a tongue I couldn't understand. These came to be accompanied, of course, by the panic and adrenaline rush of foresight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I could fight the aura, and avoid a seizure. At least, it felt like I could. I could lay down, clench my fists, stare at the ceiling, and let the sensations pass over me without a seizure. Other times this failed. It probably only felt like I was "beating" them. Illusion of free will and all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my main triggers are stress and sleep deprivation. Not very conducive to the grad student lifestyle, at least as I had been living it. Eventually I learned to cope. Take on less. Give up on a deadline early if it looks like an unsustainable amount of stress would be needed. Sleep more. Oversleep out of an abundance of caution. Seizures would still came but it felt like I had things under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know exactly how many seizures I had between January 2018 and August 2020. I lived on my own and I was able to handle them at home, lay down on my stomach when I felt them coming, so I wouldn't choke on my vomit. I still wasn't medicated, which gave me quite a bit of freedom&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I took an internship in Japan. I worked in Pittsburgh for a little over half a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed my masters and applied to PhD programs. Living in Pittsburgh, I took the offer to come back to the west coast to PhD at UCSB. For the pandemic, I moved back home with my parents and did my first year of PhD in my childhood bedroom in Mesa, AZ. Financially this was a good decision, socially I'm not sure, but safety-wise, this turned out to be very prescient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Injuries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a seizure where I dislocated my right shoulder. It turns out, the human body is very strong---if you swing your arm straight up and continue rotating backward, with all of your strength, your arm can pull itself out of its own socket. Finally, far too late, I met with a second neurologist to get on my first seizure medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't have a sophisticated causal understanding of epilepsy. It is a descriptive label to an idiosyncratic set of seizure disorders that can't be explained by tumors or drugs. Thus, there is no clear way to know a-priori how to treat it. The process of finding a treatment to manage epilepsy is individual and iterative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my arm in a sling and in the middle of a physical therapy regimen, I moved to Santa Barbara to start my second year of my PhD. I transitioned to a new neurologist and continued the process of slowly ramping up my medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a little hard to do research with one arm, but I was mostly able to manage. Lots of people would ask me why my arm was in a sling. I would mumble something about skateboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a low base rate of seizures is a blessing and a curse. You can't know if a treatment is really working until it fails to stop several seizures. How could I know that the medicine wasn't increasing my threshold, and I was only still having them from time to time because I was doing something wrong? Maybe I needed to stress less, sleep more? My medicine made me naturally crankier, and raised my brain-mouth barrier&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so I wanted to avoid increasing the dose at all cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the seizures didn't stop, and I started dislocating my arm more. After the third or fourth breakthrough seizure, my neurologist convinced me to start raising the dose. We kept cranking it up, hoping the seizures would stop. Maybe they slowed down? It was unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They came in embarrassing times. I had to explain to my desk neighbor that I was stopping my work to lay down on my jacket out of an abundance of caution because I had felt the sensations---she didn't need to worry and if I had a seizure, she needed to only call 911 if it lasted more than a couple minutes. One time, when I was alone in lab, I did have a seizure, and vomited on the carpet. Embarrassed and sore, I wiped it up off the carpet myself, and there's still a small stain&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the maximum dose, they still didn't stop. I didn't want to try a new one and risk worsening things. But the dislocations also continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have observed a scaling law in arm dislocations. The human shoulder has recursive self-improvement in dislocation capabilities. When one happens, it damages the tendons, cartilage, and bones, making the next one easier. By the third or fourth I had, the ER doctor implored me to get reconstructive surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The easy fix?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring that the last thing I should do is let myself mess up the expensive repair job, I finally gave in and agreed to try a new medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the surgery, and had the longest period of arm non-use yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The medicine worked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had the most productive period of my PhD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has now been a year since my last seizure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can confidently drive again. I feel like I can live long term in the sun belt again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like such an idiot. This is all I had to do?! But my obstinance toward drug experimentation is in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looking back&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life will never be quite the same as it was before, and my experience with epilepsy drove important changes in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to skip an exciting visiting scholar opportunity for my shoulder surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have anxieties related to the seizures that will probably not abate for a long time. Every moment of deja vu scares the hell out of me. Weird coping habits I developed linger. I developed the habit of almost always listening to some kind of podcast or speech, just so I could immediately notice if the loss of language understanding has come. Or if I did feel overwhelmed by the aura, I would have something to focus on and maybe beat back the seizure. This auditory safety blanket definitely hampered my ability to sit and ponder, and I am getting used to feeling comfortable without it and sitting in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This need for constant audio started with a seizure and hospitalization during one of my summer internships. I feel like learning to work with this coping mechanism played a part in derailing my intern project&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My epilepsy robbed me of music---my most cherished hobby---for years. I have played piano since childhood, producing my own arrangements of music from perfect pitch. As any musician would tell you, sitting at the piano was the ultimate form of active relaxation. In my first year of the PhD, I felt a new set of overwhelming sensations overcome me when I was playing the piano, triggering a seizure. I didn't touch the piano for several weeks, and when I did again, the same sensation happened. Out of an abundance of caution, I stopped making music completely---I didn't want to strengthen the connection, and I didn't want to trigger any unnecessary seizures. I had to mostly stop listening to piano music as I felt like the sensations may start. Once you get in your own head, the fear of feeling the aura, or the doubt of whether a sensation is part of the aura or not, starts to feel like the aura in and of itself. I had to cut it off entirely, and I stopped engaging with music for four years. Should I try again? I want to, but I think I'll wait longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I'm better now though. I certainly hope I am! There's a bit of survivor's guilt in that. A friend has had his life be completely derailed by debilitating epilepsy---what right do I have to feel disadvantaged by mine?? How can I feel joy for seemingly "overcoming" my disability while so many continue to suffer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I am still struggling with these questions. Writing this was a bit of an act of self-therapy to get over it. I hope to help others like me in my career going forward. I wonder what the best way to do that is. I wonder if I count as disabled. How should I identify myself? Will my epilepsy ever really be "cured?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I know for now, is that I am extremely grateful looking back on 2024. I was more productive than ever. I made some great friends. And I didn't have any seizures. Here's to continuing this trend in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;probably&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's so fun entering your early 20s---your friends will all start finding out who drew the neurological short straws!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, his case was extremely severe, with multi-hour periods of dozens of seizures, etc; a fact I should have considered when refusing drugs.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a massive impediment to a full life in Phoenix, Arizona&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albeit, with very limited driving&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in the thoughtful/inhibited speech way; in the slow, tongue tied, and word salad-y way.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stain has thankfully since been covered by a larger stain from an AC leak.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That and losing my work laptop in a classic SF smash-and-grab robbery...&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:8" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Why I think my applications worked well, what I wish I did differently, and links to my actual statements and feedback from the GRFP reviewing panel.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;On applying to PhD programs (and the NSF GRFP) in NLP and ML&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm not a particularly important person with singular sage advice, I still often find myself coaching aspiring applicants for PhD programs (and fellowship applications), and have a much better understanding of the process now than I did at my application time.
So, I'm documenting the nuggets of advice I do have here to save me a bit of time sharing them with my mentees, and hopefully others will get some use out of them too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an US citizen or permanent resident entering a PhD in CS, you absolutely must apply for the &lt;a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/"&gt;National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP)&lt;/a&gt; grant. 
Your odds are quite good. 
This program is basically structured as a carrot to help Americans pursue careers in science, and is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as selective as NDSEG, Hertz, or the insanely competitive fellowships from Google, Microsoft, etc.
It has a roughly 1 in 8 acceptance rate---a well-written application has a great chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback and advivce from mentors and previous awardees were instrumental in my successful GRFP app.
In particular, I made use of sample statements passed around privately from prior applicants at my alma mater, ASU.
I suspect the network effects of having more prior applicant peers who were sharing their statements as well as more organized adivsing explains the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nsf-graduate-fellowships-disproportionately-go-students-few-top-schools"&gt;"elite institution" bias&lt;/a&gt; of GRFP award statistics.
Hopefully if more of us share our advice and statements, this gulf can be narrowed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General advice and best practices synthesized from myself and others, with links to some other detailed posts and example statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links to my own statements &lt;strong&gt;and the feedback the NSF reviewers gave me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A discussion of why I think my application was successful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. What the GRFP reviewers are looking for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zportman.com/blog/applying-for-the-nsf-grfp"&gt;Zach Portman&lt;/a&gt; released his statements on his desire to pursue research about bees. Consequently, he talks about his interest in them and how that inspired him to pursue research in biology. I cosign this statement from him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the personal element of the application and demonstrate &lt;strong&gt;a pattern of determination and curiosity&lt;/strong&gt; about science in general. One of the main mistakes I see in other people who apply for the GRFP is that they focus almost entirely on their research proposal and neglecting the personal elements. It’s important to remember that &lt;strong&gt;the purpose of the GRFP is to nurture promising scientists, not necessarily to fund the best scientific proposals&lt;/strong&gt; (although these often go together). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowan Zellers similarly shared &lt;a href="https://rowanzellers.com/blog/nsf-grfp/"&gt;a good post with advice&lt;/a&gt;  on GRFP apps specifically for NLP. An important point that he hammers home is that the statement &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; need to convincingly address a real broader impact, which may at first brush seem the reverse of Zach's advice, but they are actually well aligned. From Rowan's post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NSF does not expect you to actually carry out your research proposal. On the contrary, the research proposal requirement seems to test your ability to sketch out a coherent research plan for a couple of years... and to discuss its (hopefully fantastic!) *broader impact on society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that you need to show your promise as a scientist who can plan a &lt;em&gt;concrete and attainable project&lt;/em&gt; you &lt;strong&gt;demonstrably care about&lt;/strong&gt; (grounded in your prior work) and are on board for the &lt;strong&gt;mission of publicly funded science&lt;/strong&gt;---&lt;em&gt;helpfully impacting society&lt;/em&gt; through your research---and that you &lt;strong&gt;understand how the former fits in to the latter&lt;/strong&gt;.
Note here that I italicized the attainability of the project and the final impact, while I bolded ideas of "caring" "having a mission" and "understanding."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You only need to show &lt;strong&gt;you have promise and your heart is in the right place&lt;/strong&gt;; you are not being stack ranked against candidates on any objective measure of project plan---they don't even expect you to specifically carry out your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to emphasize this point from Rowan's post, on soliciting feedback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should talk to people in your area as well as not in your area. That's good for two reasons: you want to &lt;strong&gt;make sure that your application is easy to understand for a non-specialist&lt;/strong&gt;, but on the same token, if someone in your area happens to read your application, you don't want them to ding you points for feasibility or correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your application readers may be in any field of computer science (or electrical engineering, etc), with no knowledge of your research topic at all, but they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be NLP experts as well. You need to thread the needle of maximizing understandability for non-experts while minimizing the impression of oversimplification for experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the process of actually preparing your application and submitting, Alex Lang provides a useful &lt;a href="https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship"&gt;application guide&lt;/a&gt;, including an annotated copy of the call for proposals and a timeline to take for preparing your statements. Also, he has a &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xoezGhbtcpg3BvNdag2F5dTQM-Xl2EELUgAfG1eUg0s/edit?gid=0#gid=0"&gt;giant spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; containing hundreds application samples from tons of fields; definitely take a look at some examples in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also asked some successful applicant friends for their thoughts on applying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my reviewer feedback was about &lt;strong&gt;my background being good prep for the proposed direction&lt;/strong&gt; + strong service/outreach. I applied as an undergrad, so &lt;strong&gt;I didn’t link the proposal to a specific advisor&lt;/strong&gt;. I had a feasibility paragraph where I discussed where I’d get data, how I’d run experiments, and some concrete statements on how my training prepared me to do the proposed research etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, you really should focus on telling a story that connects to your demonstrated background and explains why you can do good research. It does not matter if you actually do the project you proposed.
You don't even need to tie your application to a specific advisor (though there can be benefits to doing so, as I did, see below for more discussion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other friends gave me more lighthearted stories from their applications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally wouldn’t dig too far in the reviews, one of them thought I went to UCLA lol (from a student from a different UC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panelists are really trying to breeze through these. Passing is really about meeting a 1/8 bar for excellence, not about being the very best of all your peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spelled "sociolect" wrong over and over in my research statement. I became a fellow anyways, but maybe good to know that they don't check spelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said---the panelists are reading fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. My GRFP statements and feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two statements you will submit are "&lt;strong&gt;Graduate Research Plan Statement&lt;/strong&gt;" and a &lt;strong&gt;personal statement&lt;/strong&gt; ("Personal, Relevant Background, and Future Goals Statement"). 
Additionally, you provide your CV, and solicit 3 letters of recommendation from mentors. Here's what I submitted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Graduate Research Plan Statement: &lt;a href="../../../doc/grfp_statements/research-plan.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My personal statement: &lt;a href="../../../doc/grfp_statements/personal-statement.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My CV at PhD application time: &lt;a href="../../../doc/grfp_statements/cv-2019.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you apply, you get feedback from the reviewers (whether your application was accepted or rejected). Here's the feedback I got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback I received from the reviewer panel: &lt;a href="../../../doc/grfp_statements/reviewer-feedback.pdf"&gt;pdf link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Why do I think I succeeded in applying for NSF GRFP?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the following were key elements to my success:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Obnoxious formatting.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I absolutely went to town &lt;strong&gt;bolding&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;italicizing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;underlining&lt;/em&gt; and combination-of-those-three formatting the text in my statements. &lt;strong&gt;Please make sure you do this&lt;/strong&gt; (with taste) in order &lt;em&gt;to hammer home the few key points from each set of paragraphs&lt;/em&gt;, to highlight the key definitions, etc. I even write my papers this way, it really helps &lt;em&gt;make sure readers don't miss key points.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A project that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am well positioned to do.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My proposed project was &lt;strong&gt;a direct continuation of my demonstrated experience&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though GRFP reviewers are explicitly told they're reviewing candidates, not project proposals, and that the proposal is a sample project, not a commitment, they still may judge your proposal like it's any other NSF proposal. Write a proposal describing what you think you can most convincingly show them that &lt;strong&gt;you can do right now&lt;/strong&gt; and then pivot to what you actually want to do once you have the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Application area that I'm experienced in.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I applied in the electrical engineering track rather than the computer science track&lt;/strong&gt;. I did this for several reasons; I was applying to a mixture of CS and ECE programs (NLP and Speech broadly) and had more of a speech background, so applying as ECE made sense to match up to my strongest-project-I-can-execute (see 1.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I think I benefited applying &lt;strong&gt;as a deep learning person within ECE&lt;/strong&gt; because those reviewers were probably seeing a much more diverse range of proposals&amp;mdash;people working on signal processing, people working on power efficiency, etc were all in my pool&amp;mdash;had I applied as a CS person perhaps they would have not found this invocation of deep learning as novel or exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My description of a research agenda of pretraining good adaptable deep learning backbones (which was very much the zeitgeist at that time) for the specific problem area of clinical speech analysis (which is an easy-to-motivate problem but &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a massive research community)
perhaps gave me a best-of-both-worlds outcome where readers didn't view me as yet another exhausting applicant trying to ride the DL zeitgeist. Maybe consider this before building your app around LLMs 😉. Also, &lt;strong&gt;GRFP panels are explicitly trying to have balance, and award grants to a wide array of topics&lt;/strong&gt;.
In a less crowded field your chances are better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Authentically personal statement on my disability contextualized my CV.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I think my application went well because I was able to convincingly motivate why I'm interested in the problem area I proposed (neurological disease) by relating it to my own personal story (having a neurological disease). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I didn't originally plan to do this, but was suggested to do so by mentors). I think this improved my application by further convincing the panel that I'm a good pick for someone to advance that area, and it served double duty with implicitly justifying deficiencies in my CV that were impacted by my condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.nelsonliu.me/2020/10/13/nsf-grfp-materials/"&gt;Nelson Liu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://anjalief.github.io/statements.html"&gt;Anjalie Field&lt;/a&gt; have uploaded their successful statements standing alone, they're a great resource to look at if you want more examples of successful apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Guo wrote some amazing stuff on how to apply to the GRFP (and PhD programs in general) in the past, but has unfortunately chosen to completely nuke them. Here's where I would put links to them, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omguEZ7jy5E"&gt;IF I HAD ONE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any further questions about applying to the GRFP, or &lt;strong&gt;if you have your own previous successful application materials that you would like to share with me so I can distribute them as examples for other prospective applicants&lt;/strong&gt; please email me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a modest collection of other people's successful applications. While I am not comfortable just posting them all, I will share them with you privately, &lt;strong&gt;provided you then share &lt;em&gt;your statements back to me&lt;/em&gt; after so I can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abBabSWyNOI"&gt;add them to my collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Career"></category><category term="PhD"></category><category term="Admissions"></category><category term="NSF GRFP"></category><category term="Applications"></category></entry><entry><title>The ACL Anonymity Embargo Period is exclusionary, actually: an early-career researcher's perspective</title><link href="saxon.me/blog/2023/anti-acl-anon/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-15T14:44:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-09-15T14:44:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Saxon</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-09-15:saxon.me/blog/2023/anti-acl-anon/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Preprinting and promoting one's work online is one of the most impactful and accessible career advancement methods for early-career researchers. Policies that hinder this process are thus disproportionately harmful to early career scientists, relative to their senior peers. As online promotion is more accessible than traditional routes of namebuilding, we contend that depriving "low-prestige institution"-affiliated early-career researchers of this avenue for self-advancement futher disproportionately harms them relative to their "high-prestige" peers. Finally, a broad culture of posting quality preprints has community-level and scientific benefits. We contend that the ACL anonymity policy is harmful for the ways in which it forces early-career researchers (ECRs) to choose between participating in ACL or doing what's best for their careers.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In case you're unfamiliar, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), the premier venue for natural language processing (NLP) research, has an extremely strict "anonymity embargo policy," restricting the ability of researchers to publicly share or discuss their latest work online within a time window starting 1 month prior to a given conference's submission deadline, through the date when acceptance decisions are conveyed (about a four month period). &lt;strong&gt;The ACL Executive committe is currently considering abolishing this policy, and I strongly believe removing it is the right thing for both our science and community, and in particular I think removing it will, on the balance, have inclusionary outcomes for early-career researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay is my attempt at laying bare the harms this policy visits on early career researchers as an inclusion-oriented argument for its removal. In particular, I will argue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That social media self-promotion is a crucial career development tool that &lt;strong&gt;all early-career researchers benefit from&lt;/strong&gt; and has a &lt;strong&gt;leveling effect across existing hierarchies of institutional prestige&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That discussing one's most recent research &lt;strong&gt;using preprints is integral to online self-promo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the reduction in preprinting achieved under the current policy comes by &lt;strong&gt;disproportionately stifling the participation of the least privileged ECRs&lt;/strong&gt; in the public self-promotion process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That these exclusionary effects are disproportionately visited on &lt;strong&gt;cross-disciplinary researchers in AI, ML, and computer vision-adjacent subfields&lt;/strong&gt; who we really ought to keep in the *ACL community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in many other arguments for why the embargo policy should be repealed, beyond those presented here. In particular, I think claims that it significantly protects the integrity of double-blind review are unsubstantiated, or at the very least too questionable to justify the documented costs the policy has on the community. In any case, we leave those points to be argued by others or in future posts. &lt;strong&gt;Here the focus is on the "exclusionary harm to ECRs" angle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In allowing preprints only for those who can meet an arbitrary and difficult filter, it produces a class of authors who can choose to operate without anonymity, and a class who cannot (as their papers are incomplete by the onerous month-in-advance embargo deadline). 
In trying to split the difference between two irreconcilable states of equality (preprints for all or preprints forbidden) it produces a novel sort of inequality where only some authors are even given the ability to decide.
This worst-of-all-worlds compromise is akin to King Solomon's offer to give half of the baby to each self-proclaimed mother&amp;mdash;we must choose one option or the other.
By communicating why so many ECRs are so opposed to this policy, I hope to aid the community in finding a consensus option.
&lt;strong&gt;All I ask is for is that everyone consider this angle, the way in which ECRs are hindered in traversing the prestige hierarchy when they are shut out of online promotion and preprinting, when doing the fairness calculus to decide how to balance the concerns of anonymity and its consequences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing as the hierarchies of privilege that DEI initiatives are meant to address are often embedded within the prestige hierarchies at the forefront of discussions of career fairness, I sincerely believe that policies which uphold or worsen disparities along institutional prestige hierarchies represent a fundamental failure of inclusion. 
Putting early-career researchers in a double bind where they cannot have both broadly accessible hierarchy-leveling online self-promotion and prompt conference participation, the ACL embargo policy is thus counter-inclusionary, and must be repealed at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will now provide more lengthy explanations for why I believe each of the four points above to be true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimers: Parts of this essay are written in a raw style; I seek to convey both the rationale and emotions behind my support for the swift removal of the embargo policy. 
Apologies if you feel I have unfairly characterized your position or motivations. 
Although I consider this policy exclusionary, I recognize the well-intentionedness of its creators and supporters, and do not hold malice towards them. 
Sorry it's so wordy, if I had more time I would have written it shorter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social media self-promotion is key for early career researcher (ECR) success and leveling across prestige hierarchies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name- and reputation-building are necessary for a successful scientific career.
Although NLP has become a much more crowded and "faster" field than it was before the late 2010s, the "traditional" avenues by which previous generations of scientists have built reputations&amp;mdash;including participating in conferences, publishing in journals, and being invited to deliver talks and share one's work&amp;mdash;remain integral steps on the path of career advancement for the current generation of ECRs.
As always, active effort and strategy are necessary to translate quality research into career-boosting readership.
However, in this fast-paced research environment the capacity of these traditional avenues is strained, leading to increasingly noisy acceptance/award decisions on an ever growing mass of submissions.
Overwhelmed readers rely on the time-honored heuristics of author prestige and word of mouth to decide which works are deserving of attention, and as always these poor signals favor entrenched privileged groups by default.
However, there is a silver lining in the modern research climate: the internet has given powerful and accessible tools to modify one's own position within the status hierarchies that drive these heuristics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online self-promotion is an exciting new way to build one's reputation, free from the constraints of proximity within physical space and institutional networks. 
Productively contributing to online discussions and marketing one's fresh work is a great way to become "known" within the research community that is more rapid and accessible than the traditional avenues. 
It isn't a surprise that many scientists across disciplines are enthusiastically taking advantage of this new avenue for career advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual benefits of namebuilding&amp;mdash;in any form&amp;mdash;produce a virtuous cycle for the individual as opportunities beget more opportunities. 
However, this virtuous cycle for the individual can be a driver of field-level inequality of opportunity when starting points are taken in to account; 
after all, geographic and institutional biases continue to set the initial conditions for reputational hierarchies, as they always have.
A consequence of the compounding nature of this cycle is a "rich get richer" process for early career researchers who are already well-positioned relative to their peers. 
&lt;strong&gt;The fundamentally open nature of online self-promotion is both fairer for individuals and better for science, as it enables a truer meritocracy by building an alternative to traditional physical prescense- and network-reliant namebuilding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's consider internships and fellowships as two illustrative examples. For as long as these opportunities have existed, 
they have favored candidates in stronger positions in the aforementioned priviledge hierarchies.
As ever, private channels favoring those connected in well-networked institutions tilt the scales.
Intern hiring managers can and do reach out to their advisor friends for recommended candidates (often their own students), and fellowship opportunities are often promoted through department mailing lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to predictable outcomes, such as &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nsf-graduate-fellowships-disproportionately-go-students-few-top-schools"&gt;students from top universities disproportionately winning NSF fellowships&lt;/a&gt; as the application coaching networks within these institutions organize to help their applicants prepare stronger proposals. 
These networks certainly exist in non-elite institutions&amp;mdash;I owe my own NSF grant to the advice of a small network of previous winners I knew personally at Arizona State and my MS advisor Visar Berisha's time and advice in reviewing my application&amp;mdash;but building these advising networks without a well-organized institutional advising machine is both non-trivially difficult and requires a lot of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online self-promotion is an exciting disruption to this career advancement hierarchy status quo.&lt;/strong&gt;
Hiring managers now solicit applicants directly on Twitter, and "namebuilt" ECRs can gain a connectedness advantage in the application process over the internet, regardless of institutional affiliation. 
Similarly, where fellowship aspirants previously could solely rely on institutional and advisory networks for application coaching, they can now find that advice over the internet, and provide an "adviceworthiness" signal through their publicly available work and by gaining followership.
I strongly believe that on the balance the democratization of in-community namebuilding that social media has brought about has a &lt;strong&gt;strong leveling effect across axes of institutional prestige and advisor connectedness&lt;/strong&gt;, at least within visa jurisdictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the balance, social media participation improves the fairness and inclusion of career-level outcomes within scientific communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consequently, ACL's embargo policy negatively impacts career outcome fairness and inclusion in our community by interfering with early career researchers' ability to speak freely and openly about their work. In hindering the most accessible avenue to name-building, it entrenches the powerful position of the more institutionally privileged in attaining opportunities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Career-impacting self-promo is time-sensitive for ECRs, warranting preprinting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far all points have only argued for general participation in namebuilding through online self-promotion. &lt;em&gt;But why is a pro-preprinting culture important?&lt;/em&gt; We believe there are two key benefits for individual authors, and one for the community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual authors can "namebuild" faster and more effectively when they are able to discuss their latest and most freshest work, and preprinting provides a critical multi-month head start in doing so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scooping is prevented in a materially beneficial way that is not provided by anonymized preprints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The whole community gets &lt;strong&gt;higher-quality, fresher&lt;/strong&gt; preprints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is high speed namebuilding important for early-career researchers? 
Many ECRs are students, who have a limited number of summers to expend on critical research opportunities such as internships. 
A monthslong period muzzled from discussing a student's most recent work can literally mean the difference between a career trajectory-defining internship opportunity and an empty summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned actively online internship hirers are paying attention to their subcommunity. 
They see preprints and follow discussions of the important problems in their area, particularly those related to the very topics they are hiring interns for.
&lt;strong&gt;The less well-known a student is in their topic area, the more important it is that they get preprints online for a chance at this attention,&lt;/strong&gt; thereby starting their virtuous growth cycle.
Thus, it is imperative for greener students to get quality preprints demonstrating their work up as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the *ACL anonymity policy creates a double-bind: &lt;strong&gt;taking the time to get a better preprint out conflicts with the ability to publish&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the case (that I regrettably know well) in which a student switches topics mid-PhD.
This student is subject to the dual pressures of publish-or-delay-graduation-milestones (which would require submission to the earliest possible *ACL deadline) and the imperatives to build credibility in their new topic area as fast as possible.
When they've produced a significant work that fits the topic for a job opportunity they're looking for, the stakes get even higher.
After all, they'll be the most likely to recieve fair consideration for the role if their work is publicly available, and perhaps a team member or recruiter who's hiring will see the work; 
but skipping a deadline could cost the work's "countability" toward graduation milestones in a worst case scenario of review purgatory.
&lt;em&gt;Are we really getting sufficient benefit for the pain of forcing our ECRs to make this choice?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This calculus becomes even more challenging when "scooping" (the risk of someone else independently announcing an extremely similar result to yours) is considered.
Obviously, unrestricted, just-in-time-open-preprinting is the best way to protect against being otherwise scooped during the review embargo period.
Some suggest that &lt;em&gt;anonymized preprints&lt;/em&gt; such as those implicitly produced by the OpenReview process ICLR uses are a preferable compromise to fully &lt;em&gt;free preprints&lt;/em&gt; as they reduce scooping risk.
While people do read (and find inspiration!) in these anonymized preprints, the aforementioned namebuilding benefits aren't there. 
Furthermore, authors who are inspired by anonymized preprints are forced to cite the anonymous preprint, and those citations do not propagate through attribution systems such as Google Scholar. (&lt;a href="https://scholar.hasfailed.us/"&gt;Add that as a relatively trivial reason to not use it on top of the trans-exclusion it perpetuates!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, my labmate Weixi produced an &lt;a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=PUIqjT4rzq7"&gt;awesome work on improving compositionality and attribute binding in text-to-image models&lt;/a&gt; that went to ICLR 2023, but declined to immediately preprint his ICLR draft at submission time in September, opting to instead &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05032"&gt;preprint in December&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, when my friend Royi was inspired in part by this work in his &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10606"&gt;study of duplications in DALL-E 2&lt;/a&gt;, he was forced to cite it as "Anonymous (2022)." That review didn't count towards Weixi's citation count or h-index on Google Scholar (but it did on Semantic Scholar so maybe you should switch 😉).
Seeing as this paper has been very successful (60 Google Scholar-attributed citations in 2023 alone, better than any of mine so far!), and Weixi was able to eventually put up a deanonymized preprint during the decision window, the impact on his career-driving bibliometrics was minimal. 
But imagine the counterfactual where this preprinting was not allowed. How many more of 60 of those attributed citations of Weixi's work would instead be attributed to "Anonymous," and his highest cited first-author paper would only be 2. 
I think it's reasonable to believe that the sweet internship he landed working on text-to-image models this summer would have been more difficult to get without this significant degree of quantified impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Weixi's decision to post a preprint in December 2022 only cost him a very small amount of attributable citations in the greater scheme of things, I also think that if he had rushed to push out a half-formed preprint of his paper in August 2022 rather than a polished, finished one in December 2022, the impact of his work might have been severely hampered. I certainly observe that my month-in-advance preprints are worse than my submission-time papers, and I think it's reasonable to assume both that others feel this way about their own work, and that these worse papers have blunted impact both in terms of readership and namebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be better for the *ACL community as a whole if we stopped incentivizing rushed and sloppy preprints? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why the documented impact on anonymity is an exclusionary double-bind that disproportionately impacts low-prestige ECRs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boknilev/status/1698941506206253321"&gt;many students explicitly prefer to skip an ACL deadline in order to get on arXiv.&lt;/a&gt; 
Of course, situations like this only arise when a project is completed so last-minute that preprinting is completely impossible under the embargo policy. 
&lt;strong&gt;But what kinds of researchers are most likely to have a project that finishes last minute, which is rendered completely unpreprintable by the embargo policy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contend that most researchers who are finishing their project right at the deadline are students. 
After all, corporate researchers work from project timelines that typically require a complete paper draft for internal review prior to submission anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, I contend that earlier stage students and students who have recently switched topics are more likely to be in this situation &lt;strong&gt;consequentially&lt;/strong&gt; (as discussed above) than more experienced students who are established in their topic area.
&lt;strong&gt;In other words, the most likely authors to be stuck in the aforementioned namebuilding double-bind are also the individuals who need the benefits of namebuilding the most.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher-prestige or more senior authors don't have reasons to worry about this double-bind;
missing 6 months of publicity for a single project, or skipping a single project's chance to get in to the soonest conference is not as consequential for them.&lt;/strong&gt; 
It should be easy to see how this creates an exclusionary dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the uniqueness of our community's embargo policy is confusing enough to newcomers that it borders on being hostile to aspiring new members. 
Even for community members, the constant changes the policy undergoes are a burden. 
For example, ACL 23 uniquely had a "posting date" rather than "upload date" anonymity deadline, effectively shifting enforcement of it to the whims of various preprinting servers, such as arXiv's archaic once-a-day mailing list cutoff requiring a server-side tex compile, further compounding the headache of complying to the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the alternative "upload date" cutoff that is typical, confusions like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nsaphra/status/1698697352238813538"&gt;Zack's off-by-half-an-hour error in arXiv submission time&lt;/a&gt; led to this undergraduate's first-ever submission being desk rejected after the rebuttal period, despite this upload time error having no materially significant differences for deanonymization relative to embargo-compliant papers uploaded only 30 minutes before, as they were all made publicly available by the arXiv at the same time. &lt;strong&gt;Weird interactions between the strict cutoffs inherent to a preprint embargo and the vagaries of preprint servers are making our field hostile to newcomers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we are disproportionately shutting ECRs out of the benefits of preprinting and self-promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is broadly agreed that to the extent it succeeds, the *ACL Anonymity Embargo Policy "protects double-blind review" simply by reducing the total amount of preprints that are available before acceptance decisions are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we contend that the reduction in preprinting that is produced by the policy is largely a de-facto muzzling of public discussion of the freshest ideas in our community from some less-advantaged authors. These authors are thus forced to choose between missing out on the benefits of participation in *ACL venues or suffering the many ACL-external consequences to not preprinting. such as missing out on engagement for their work at its freshest, missing out on media opportunities, missing out on citations, and missing out on career advancement/fellowship/job opportunities that would otherwise be available. In short, the ACL Anonymity Embargo Policy, while well-intentioned, is a de-facto burden on our least advantaged authors, particularly early career researchers, and further disadvantages them relative to their peers in other fields who are able to preprint early. As ECRs we believe the only sensible move is to abolish this policy completely, ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why this policy is driving away researchers in a disciplinary overlap, and why that's a bad thing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all subfields within ACL are equally enthusiastic about the preprinting and online discussion-centered mode of conduct we have been describing above. 
In particular, the more "artificial intelligence"-oriented subfields within NLP, such as those concerned with understanding and developing applications using large language models (LLMs), those studying core machine learning techniques as applied to NLP problems, and those who work on multimodal systems such as speech, vision, and robotics seem to be the most gung-ho about preprinting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a big reason for this is that the authors in this &lt;em&gt;disciplinary overlap&lt;/em&gt; are bound to norms and incentive structures that are outside of *ACL's exclusive control.
All of the aforementioned subfields &lt;strong&gt;overlap substantially with non-NLP disciplines&lt;/strong&gt;, and their research is in dialogue with work that appears at non-*ACL conferences. 
Many *ACL participants already also publish in venues such as ICLR, NeurIPS, AAAI, CVPR, ICCV, ICML, Interspeech, etc, all of which do not have our unique restrictive embargo policy. 
They are thus both subject to cultural influence from the overlapping disciplines and, more importantly, &lt;strong&gt;subject to the same incentive structures as scientists in these overlapping disciplines&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the career-relevant scenarios discussed above, how can an ACL regular and ICLR regular compete for the same fellowship, or the same internship position, when the ICLR regular is at a structural advantage for namebuilding and career progress? &lt;strong&gt;The interaction between the embargo policy and structural incentives in the CS-interdisciplinary NLP subfields is slowly but surely driving promising ECRs away through this career outcome handicap.&lt;/strong&gt; All the aforementioned disparities with how this handicap hurts students across hierarchies continue to apply. I think this is extremely bad for our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is tangential to the core ECR fairness issue we've been addressing here, I think the reasons why &lt;strong&gt;the ACL community ought to not push out our overlapping-discipline-members&lt;/strong&gt; is fundamentally driven by the namebuilding mechanims we've been discussing above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, the public nature of social media means that an online following built within the scientific community is effectively &lt;em&gt;dual use&lt;/em&gt; in its transferability to the general public! 
A platform built through quality layperson-oriented scientific communication is thus useful for career advancement, implicitly rewarded through the incentive structure benefits for namebuilding. 
In a time of serious hype and misinformation around the capabilities of large language models, is it really wise to muzzle the scientists most well-equipped to inform the public from sharing their freshest expertise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When certain agi animals talk about *ACL as some kind of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/agihippo/status/1699280900100636880"&gt;backup venue&lt;/a&gt; for "non-ICLR-worthy" ideas in LLMs, yes, they are being ignorant. 
I understand why many in *ACL are weary of a deluge of "look at this prompt I invented" papers.
However, it seems clear to me that ceding the ground for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; discussion of important modern issues in AI to their ilk is good for neither the *ACL research community nor the world. 
I sincerely believe that the distinctive population of positions our community holds on "language understanding AI" and its responsible use makes us the best venue for level-headedly and objectively responding to impacts from and driving the advances of these generation-defining, societally influential technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the world would be served well if central discussion around LLMs happened in venues where Emily Bender and Geoff Hinton can argue about the meaning of understanding, 
computational social scientists are central rather than sideshow,
and papers centered on Terminator doomsday scenarios are far less regularly accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Call to action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/survey-anonymity-period-policy"&gt;Please, &lt;strong&gt;CAST YOUR VOTE IN FAVOR OF REMOVING BOTH THE PREPRINT AND SOCIAL MEDIA EMBARGOS HERE&lt;/strong&gt; before the September 22, 2023 deadline.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This survey is the beginning of a discussion of change in our community, not a binding vote to decide future policy. 
Ultimately, changes are up for the ACL Executive Committee to decide. 
When we get there, stay tuned for posts explicitly laying out the cases for and against the only two alternatives: free discussion for all and complete preprint and discussion shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How I answered the survey&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you're interested in how I filled out the ACL Survey, (&lt;strong&gt;Note, do not construe this as some kind of voting guide&lt;/strong&gt;) here's what I put:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think of the first proposed change that allows authors to freely make versions of their submitted paper available online at any time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I support the proposed change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think of the second proposed change that allows authors to mention their preprints at any time, including on social media?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I support the proposed change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think that either changing or not changing these policies would potentially harm your career, or harm you in some other way, please explain: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early-career researchers need the ability to promptly share their preprints online for time-sensitive opportunities such as internships and fellowships. As an ECR I think the first change is absolutely necessary. The second change would further enable ECRs to freely discuss their freshest work, improving their ability to network and grow. As an ECR, I believe I would also benefit from the second change. I feel that not making the changes harms me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of your answers to previous questions, and assuming a “magic solution” in which author identities remain unknown to reviewers and introduce no biases during review: would you like to pre-print (some of) your papers during review and discuss them on social media? Please briefly explain your answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the reasons I support preprinting are orthogonal to acceptance, it's about career opportunites and I don't believe preprinting or not preprinting will impact my acceptance odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any other suggestions on how ACL could balance the desire for open scientific discourse with the risk that it may contribute to reviewing bias?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think if we remove the limitations we should continue collecting fine-grained data on acceptance rates and deanonymization; if the policy was preventing outcome-impacting reviewer bias, it will be visible, and we can consider reinstituting an embargo in that case with the knowledge that having it actually makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How strongly (1-5) do your future career goals require the visibility of your papers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 (extremely)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If reviewers were able to see de-anonymized versions of my submissions (including authors and affiliations), I think it would typically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither increase nor decrease&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mainly publish at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACL NLP venues, ML venues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often do you use social media (e.g., Twitter) to share or discuss your paper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have thoughts I'd like to share from time-to-time. I have been testing my Pelican-based blog generator for a while and got it working, but a lack of fully-formed blogpost ideas to upload has consequently kept me from updating my website for months. This has become a problem for me as news and results have accumulated. Thus at this point, I have no choice but to push a placeholder blogpost such as this. Looking forward to making a more substantial post soon 🫡&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implemented in PL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this code! You can pass in any &lt;code&gt;Callback&lt;/code&gt; object from pytorch lightning, to track the training process of a model in pytorch lightning. This automatically collects the training dynamics statistics and writes them to a given output csv file for future processing and analysis!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this code so that I could replicate the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10795"&gt;Dataset Cartography&lt;/a&gt; features of confidence and correctness to analyze the effectiveness of my &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09237"&gt;PECO&lt;/a&gt; tool for analyzing datasets. You can see the code used in-context &lt;a href="https://github.com/michaelsaxon/DatasetAnalysis"&gt;here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="About"></category><category term="About"></category></entry></feed>
