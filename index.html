<p>I am a Computer Engineering MS student at Arizona State University, with an emphasis in multimedia signal processing and deep learning. My current research activities are centered around speech processing, natural language processing, and deep learning methods for low-resourced populations with neurological disorders, and affective computing.</p>
<p>I am excited about language technologies and the benefits they may bring to society; I am also apprehensive about how these technologies may be applied to build ideological filter bubbles and repressive surveillance regimes in the future. I am seeking a PhD program that will empower me to work in the space of maximizing societal benefits and minimizing societal harms of natural language understanding.</p>
<!--h3>Coursework</h3>
<p>My coursework choices have been selected to prepare me for this career, focusing on signal theory, signal processing, numerical methods, and AI, including <span class="mns">EEE404</span> <i>Real Time Digital Signal Processing</i>, <span class="mns">CSE310</span> <i>Algorithms and Data Structures</i>,
<span class="mns">MAT442</span> <i>Advanced Linear Algebra</i>, <span class="mns">EEE508</span> <i>Digital Image and Video Processing and Compression</i>, and <span class="mns">MAT421</span><i> Applied Computational Methods</i> to name a few.</p>
<p>In the Spring 2019 semester I will be taking <span class="mns">EEE554</span> <i>Random Signal Theory</i> and <span class="mns">EEE598</span> <i>Deep Learning for Media Processing and Understanding</i>, among other required electives.-->

<h3>Experience</h3>
<i>Current</i>
<p>I am supported as a jointly-funded RA student by the <a href="https://cubic.asu.edu/people/students">Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing</a> and Brain Behavior Analytics Labs at ASU where I am pursuing my master's thesis research on biologically inspired deep speech processing.</p>
<p>I assist members of the <a href="http://www.evsts.org/arizona-state-university.html">NSF Center for Efficient Vehicles and Sustainable Transportation Systems</a> at ASU in developing automotive synchronous multisensor collection platforms and processing LiDAR data for use in neural networks, as a continuation of the work I did with them for my EE senior design project.</p>
<i>Past</i>
<p>I took an Applied Scientist Intern position at Amazon on the Alexa Hybrid Science team in Pittsburgh, PA, between May and August 2019. In this position I developed end-to-end spoken language understanding "SLU" neural networks for intent classification.</p>
<p>I worked for <a href="https://www.auralanalytics.com">Aural Analytics</a> as a Research Engineering Intern part time between December 2018 and May 2019, developing ASR- and DSP-based methods for analyzing speech to track and potentially detect early stage degenerative brain disease.</p>
<p>I have worked in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-luminosity-lab/">The Luminosity Lab</a>, an ASU strategic initiative that rapidly builds student-led teams to attempt ambitious solutions to big problems, where I helped produce projects ranging from drone swarm communication software to chat agents for online learning platforms.  </p>
<p>Additionally, I have worked for a summer at <a href="https://gdmissionsystems.com/">General Dynamics Mission Systems</a> running software level testing for the <a href="https://gdmissionsystems.com/Articles/2017/07/27/news-release-introducing-hook3-radio">HOOK3 combat survival radio</a>, in the <a href="https://robotics.nus.edu.sg/">Social Robotics Lab</a> at the National University of Singapore, developing an emotive dialogue management system, and in the ASU <a href="https://tutoring.engineering.asu.edu/">Engineering Tutoring Center.</a></p>
