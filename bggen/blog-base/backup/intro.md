Summary: A short post introducing our new blog.


### A short introduction

This is a very exciting new year for the UCSB NLP Group. We are welcoming several new [faculty members and Ph.D. students](http://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu/people.html), and continuing to grow our research efforts! In light of this growth, we feel it is important to put together a single place to consolidate and share updates about our projects, publications, and members.

To that end, we are very excited to share the new UCSB NLP Blog and Twitter pages that we will be using to share in-depth, but slightly more informal introductions of our new work as it is released!  Please follow us on Twitter [@ucsbNLP](https://twitter.com/ucsbNLP) to see our updates when they are posted!
