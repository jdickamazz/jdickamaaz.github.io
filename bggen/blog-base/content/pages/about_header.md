Title: about_header

I study generative AI artifacts like LLMs and text-to-image models. I make **meaningful evaluations of new capabilities that are difficult to measure** to improve them.

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, advised by Prof. William Yang Wang. I am a NSF Graduate Research Fellow, a Center for Responsible ML Fellow, and a [2024 Rising Star in Generative AI](https://genai-workshop.cs.umass.edu/).
