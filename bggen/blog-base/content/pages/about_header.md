I study generative AI artifacts like LLMs and text-to-image models. I make **meaningful evaluations of new capabilities that are difficult to measure** to improve them.

I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara, advised by Prof. William Yang Wang. I was an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, a Center for Responsible ML Fellow, and a [2024 Rising Star in Generative AI](https://genai-workshop.cs.umass.edu/). Before this, I completed my M.S. in Computer Engineering and B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University.
