            My New Year's resolution is to blog regularly, even if it means writing random nonsense that has little to do with research. To start, I wanted to tell the story of my health for my research career. This is not a pity party but a documentary effort. Now that I think I have (fingers crossed) closed this chapter of my life, I feel ready to write a bit about it. A lot of this story is about me being stupid. Don't be stupid like me.
